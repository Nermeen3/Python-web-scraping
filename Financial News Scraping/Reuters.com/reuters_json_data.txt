        "article_content": "April 24 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) raised its capital expenditure forecast for 2023 on Monday as the automaker ramps up output at its factories to take advantage of the rising interest in electric vehicles.\nThe company, led by Elon Musk, said in a filing that it expects to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion this year, higher than its previous outlook of $6 billion to $8 billion.\nIt maintained the spending outlook for the next two years at $7 billion to $9 billion. Tesla's shares fell 3.3% in morning trade.\nThe world's most valuable automaker has been raising its production aggressively as it prioritises sales growth ahead of profit in a weak economy and works towards CEO Musk's bold goal of selling 20 million electric vehicles in 2030.\nAchieving that goal will make Tesla twice the size of any automaker in history, accounting for roughly 20% of the global vehicle market.\nThe company in January earmarked $3.6 billion to expand its Nevada gigafactory complex, where Tesla will mass produce its long-delayed Semi truck and build a plant for the 4680 cell that will be able to make enough batteries for 2 million light-duty vehicles annually.\nThe company is also ramping up output at its factories in Berlin and Austin, and plans to open a gigafactory in Mexico as the EV behemoth pushes to expand its global output.\nReuters reported earlier in the day that Tesla has begun producing in Shanghai a version of the Model Y to be sold in Canada this year, the first time it will ship cars to North America from China.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

        "published_date": "June 27, 2023",
        "article_content": "[1/2]A Lordstown Motors sign is seen outside the Lordstown Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio, U.S., June 21, 2021. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo\nNEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - Lordstown Motors (RIDE.O) filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday and put itself up for sale after the U.S. electric truck manufacturer failed to resolve a dispute over a promised investment from Taiwan's Foxconn.\nShares of Lordstown tumbled 35.6% in trading before the bell.\nThe automaker, named after the Ohio town where it is based, filed for Chapter 11 protection in Delaware and simultaneously took legal action against Foxconn.\nIn a complaint filed in bankruptcy court, Lordstown accused the electronics company of fraudulent conduct and a series of broken promises in failing to abide by an agreement to invest up to $170 million in the electric-vehicle manufacturer.\nFoxconn previously invested about $52.7 million in Lordstown as part of the agreement, and currently holds an almost 8.4% stake in the EV maker. Lordstown contends Foxconn is balking at purchasing additional shares of its stock as promised and misled the EV maker about collaborating on vehicle development plans.\nFoxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW), (2317.TW) and best known for assembling Apple's (AAPL.O) iPhones, has said Lordstown breached the investment agreement when the automaker's stock fell below $1 per share. Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe twin filings set up an international business clash that could intensify scrutiny of Foxconn's EV ambitions and partnerships, not only with Lordstown but also other automakers.\nThe lawsuit portrays Foxconn as consistently shifting goal posts in its collaboration with Lordstown on the automaker's future vehicles, which included failing to meet funding commitments and refusing to engage with the company on initiatives Foxconn allegedly directed and purported to support.\nLordstown, a startup launched in 2018, said in a regulatory filing earlier this month that it had planned to sue Foxconn after receiving a letter from the company that led Lordstown to believe Foxconn was unlikely to make its additional expected investment.\nLordstown accused Foxconn in that regulatory filing of engaging in a \u201cpattern of bad faith\u201d that caused \u201cmaterial and irreparable harm\u201d to the company. Even in May, Lordstown warned it might be forced to file for bankruptcy amid uncertainty over the Foxconn investment.\nThe automaker\u2019s main product is the Endurance electric pickup truck, which is built at a former General Motors small-car factory in Lordstown, Ohio, for commercial customers such as local governments. Lordstown sold the plant to Foxconn in 2022.\nLordstown paused production of the Endurance earlier this year and since April has resumed building the trucks at a low rate after resolving quality issues with suppliers. The automaker's shares have plunged since February and currently trade under $3.\nShould Lordstown fail to find a rescuer willing to re-start full production of the Endurance, the Ohio factory now owned by Foxconn could be a draw for overseas automakers looking for a quick way to build vehicles in the United States.\nLordstown filed for bankruptcy with plans to seek a buyer. It does not have an initial offer in hand, known in bankruptcy parlance as a stalking-horse bidder, which sets a minimum price other suitors can top in an auction.\nLordstown Chief Executive Edward Hightower told Reuters the Endurance business could prove attractive to another automaker looking for a fast entry into the EV market at a time the Biden administration's policies are attempting to move away from gasoline-powered cars.\nLordstown's bankruptcy is not the first among the crop of EV startups that went public during the pandemic-era SPAC boom. But Lordstown was a high-profile member of that class because it was challenging the core of the legacy Detroit automakers' business of high-margin pickup trucks, and because of its location.\nThe Lordstown factory in Northeast Ohio was formerly a GM (GM.N) small-car factory that GM decided to close in November 2018. Then-U.S. President Donald Trump and other Ohio political leaders put pressure on GM CEO Mary Barra to reverse the decision, or find a buyer. GM agreed to sell the plant to a newly-formed entity called Lordstown Motors founded by the former top executive at an electric truck maker called Workhorse Group.\nLordstown went public in October 2020 through a reverse merger with special purpose acquisition company DiamondPeak Holdings, joining a flock of EV startups that went public through such deals in that period.\nLike several others, including truck maker Nikola (NKLA.O), Lordstown has struggled to live up to the high expectations of early investors. In 2021, its chief executive and founder, Stephen Burns, resigned after the automaker acknowledged it had overstated pre-orders for its electric trucks.\nLordstown\u2019s finance chief at the time also resigned. Burns has since sold his entire stake in Lordstown, according to a June regulatory filing.\nAs Lordstown wrestled during 2021 and 2022 with investigations by regulators and the U.S. Justice Department, Ford Motor (F.N) was launching its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck, aiming at commercial customers.\nEV startup Rivian (RIVN.O) launched its luxury electric pickup in 2022. GM and Stellantis have announced plans for electric pickups. Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla (TSLA.O) has promised it will begin producing its Cybertruck late this year.\nLordstown struggled to ramp up production of its Endurance trucks over the past several months amid the dispute with Foxconn, challenging market conditions and the cost-intensive nature of its business, the company has said.\nThe few trucks that the company assembled had material costs that were \u201csubstantially higher than our selling price,\u201d Lordstown said in a May regulatory filing.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nThomson Reuters\nMike Spector is a correspondent at Reuters covering corporate crises that span bankruptcy, mass tort litigation and government investigations.

        "article_content": "June 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Monday, as investors were wary of betting on riskier assets before seeing the outcome of Russia's aborted weekend mutiny.\nThe rebellion by Russian mercenaries raised questions about President Vladimir Putin's future. While Putin on Monday thanked mercenary fighters and commanders who had stood down to avoid bloodshed, the U.S. State Department said the situation in Russia remained dynamic.\nGrowth stocks were among the biggest weights on the main indexes, with Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) all falling sharply.\nLast week, U.S. stocks sputtered after a recent rally, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq snapping its eight-week winning streak after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled there could be more interest rate hikes ahead.\n\"It doesn't feel like the all clear has sounded yet,\" said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO family office in Minneapolis, referring to Russia. \"Nobody knows what the ultimate power structure in Russia's going to look like.\"\n\"Traders are having a tough time today figuring out if they want to be offensive or defensive so they've got a foot in both camps. They don't know which way the market's going to swing,\" she said.\nAdding to uncertainty was the start of the second quarter's final week on Monday, weeks ahead of the financial reporting season. This prompted profit-taking in growth stocks that had advanced sharply so far this year, Schleif said.\nInvestors also checked out underdogs for the year-to-date such as value stocks and small caps, said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\"Out of favor themes for 2023 are working for today. Maybe in the absence of a real risk on or risk off day you go bargain hunting,\" Zaccarelli said.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 12.72 points, or 0.04%, to 33,714.71; the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 19.51 points, or 0.45%, at 4,328.82; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 156.74 points, or 1.16%, to 13,335.78.\nLeading the benchmark's industry index gainers was the energy sector (.SPNY), which rallied 2.2% as oil prices rose while investors balanced concerns about global demand growth against upcoming supply disruptions that could worsen with political instability in Russia.\nA slew of economic data including a key inflation gauge, durable goods and University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index is expected this week, as well as a speech from Powell which could throw light on the Fed's rate hike plans.\nMost policymakers see at least two more quarter-point rate increases by year-end, though traders are betting on just one hike in July, according to CMEGroup's Fedwatch tool.\nAmong single stocks, Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) fell 3.7% after the drugmaker said it was discontinuing the development of an experimental obesity and diabetes drug due to elevated liver enzymes in patients in clinical studies.\nAlphabet (GOOGL.O) fell 3.3% after UBS downgraded the stock to \"neutral,\" while Tesla (TSLA.O) sank 6% after Goldman Sachs cut the electric car maker's rating to \"neutral.\"\nLucid Group (LCID.O) rose 1.5% after entering into an agreement with UK's Aston Martin (AML.L) that will give the electric vehicle maker a 3.7% stake in the company.\nPacWest (PACW.O) climbed 4% after private-equity firm Ares Management (ARES.N) said it had acquired a $3.5 billion specialty finance loan portfolio from the lender.\nBut Carnival (CCL.N) slumped 7.6% after the cruise operator forecast third-quarter earnings below Wall Street expectations.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.91-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 154 new lows.\nOn U.S. exchanges 9.28 billion shares changed hands compared with the 11.62 billion average for the last 20 sessions.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The agency has been concerned whether Twitter had the staffing to abide by a May 2022 settlement with the FTC in which it agreed to improve its privacy practices.\nIn April, the committee subpoenaed Khan for documents related to the Twitter privacy probe following Musk's $44 billion purchase of the social media company in October.\nHouse Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan suggested in a June 8 letter \"there is an unjustified approximate one-year gap in the FTC\u2019s actions with respect to Twitter\" and added it was reasonable to conclude neither the prior chair nor Khan \"seriously planned to take action against Twitter \"until political pressure arose given Mr. Musk\u2019s impending acquisition.\"\nJordan in February also questioned the FTC's plans to adopt a new rule to ban noncompete clauses for workers and its approach to the merger of Illumina and Grail.\nSan Diego-based Illumina, which specializes in gene sequencing, is appealing an FTC order that said the company's $7.1 billion acquisition of Grail will curb competition in the cancer-testing market.

        "article_content": "[1/5]Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico's former Foreign Minister and one of the candidates pursuing the ruling MORENA party's candidacy for the 2024 presidential election, takes part in a campaign rally at a hotel in Mexico City, Mexico June 19, 2023. REUTERS/Henry Romero\nMEXICO CITY, June 26 (Reuters) - Urbane, socially progressive and eager to put Mexico on the world stage, Marcelo Ebrard presents a sharp contrast to the popular, sharp-tongued defender of the country's impoverished hinterlands he hopes to succeed as president.\nHaving followed once in the footsteps of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador as mayor of Mexico City, Ebrard is banking he can do it again in the race to be the ruling National Regeneration Movement's (MORENA) 2024 presidential candidate.\nThis month, the 63-year-old Ebrard stood down as foreign minister to seek the MORENA nomination, unleashing a contest that could strain the leftist party's unity.\nHis more business-oriented and moderate instincts stand apart from Lopez Obrador's outspoken rhetoric, but also raise doubts about whether he can get enough support from a party whose base identifies strongly with the president, analysts say.\nReuters spoke to over two dozen officials, politicians, diplomats, executives and aides to Ebrard to assess his chances of clinching the MORENA ticket for the June 2024 election.\nA winner is expected on Sept. 6 after national polling.\nLuis Huacuja, a political consultant and professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said Ebrard's experience and record appeared to make him an \"ideal\" contender.\nBut that did not mean party loyalists would, when polled, see the more centrist Ebrard as most suited to upholding Lopez Obrador's legacy, he argued.\n\"He could go down well in some quarters, and badly in others,\" Huacuja said.\nEbrard has won some early battles, persuading the president that contenders for the nomination should leave office, and that polls to pick the winner be open to the public.\nHe told Reuters \"hard\" left critics had long painted him as moderate, but said they had not governed - and that it was he who delivered results for the capital as mayor from 2006-2012.\nPrivate investment flourished during his administration, Ebrard said, pointing to how the left's appeal in Mexico City extended from poorer households to the middle class, helping his successor secure a landslide victory.\nThat support was crucial to control Congress, he argued.\n\"You need a coalition with the middle class either way,\" said Ebrard, who has been a key troubleshooter for Lopez Obrador, helping contain threats from former U.S. president Donald Trump over immigration, trade and security.\nWhile Lopez Obrador has slammed critics, clashed with business and questioned checks on presidential power, Ebrard, supporters say, is a unifier who will lift growth and reassure investors.\n\"(Ebrard) is committed to the division of powers and strengthening institutions,\" said MORENA senator Rafael Espino.\nIf nominated, Ebrard is likely to become president, polling shows. MORENA is hot favorite to win, propelled by Lopez Obrador's approval ratings of around 60%. Mexican law bars presidents from re-election.\nPolling shows Ebrard in a tight race with ex-Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, who has followed Lopez Obrador lock-step on policy. Many polls indicate Ebrard is better-known, but Sheinbaum more popular among MORENA's base. A survey published May 26 by newspaper Reforma gave Sheinbaum a slight edge.\nBoth contenders promise to defend Lopez Obrador's vision.\nAides to the president have told Reuters they believe he would most like Sheinbaum to succeed him. Lopez Obrador denies this, and says voters must decide.\nSome officials close to Lopez Obrador privately back Ebrard.\n\"We need to unite the country,\" said one.\nEbrard is careful not to criticize the president. But he has staked out his own turf.\nOn June 11, MORENA's leadership agreed guidelines for the nomination contest stating contenders should avoid talking to media deemed conservative or hostile to the administration.\nThe next morning Ebrard gave an interview to journalist Ciro Gomez Leyva - a regular target of Lopez Obrador's broadsides - and declared himself open to all media, drawing fire from some MORENA supporters.\nEbrard dismisses such criticism, and says his legalization of same-sex marriage and abortion when Mexico City mayor was more radical than anything his detractors can lay claim to.\nHis independent streak has fed speculation he could break with MORENA if he feels the contest is unfair. Ebrard denies this, but has repeatedly called for a level playing field.\nVowing to prioritize security, healthcare, education and growth, Ebrard underlines the economic opportunity presented by so-called nearshoring - increased investment spurred by Washington's trade tensions with China.\nIn February, when Lopez Obrador threatened to deny billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla permission to build a plant in northern Mexico over water supply, Ebrard stepped in to ensure the deal prospered, three officials said.\nLopez Obrador has given MORENA's contenders room to maneuver by calling the succession \"continuity with change\". But some Ebrard supporters hint he may be too independent of MORENA.\n\"Sheinbaum agrees with Lopez Obrador's political project,\" said one senior executive backing Ebrard. \"Ebrard would be a different project.\"\nA native of Mexico's poorer south, the folksy Lopez Obrador frames his presidency as the victory of a downtrodden majority over a corrupt, 'conservative' minority.\nThe president, who has described sectors of the middle class as classist and racist, forged his electoral success on years of campaigning in forgotten rural areas, rewarding support with higher welfare spending and major public works.\nThe tall, bespectacled Ebrard, a veteran Mexico City political operator, is less at home in remote villages. He has instead targeted younger, metropolitan Mexicans, making light of himself in TikTok videos peppered with pop cultural nods.\nLopez Obrador wants MORENA to win a two-thirds congressional majority in 2024 to reshape the judiciary, which has resisted his efforts to strengthen state control over the economy.\nEbrard is best placed to win that super-majority, argued MORENA senator Martha Lucia Micher.\n\"If we don't get two-thirds,\" she said, \"everything we want to do will suffer.\"\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

REUTERS/Paul Lienert/File Photo\nJune 26 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM.N) does not expect to put Tesla-compatible charging ports on its new Chevrolet Silverado EV pickups before model year 2025, it said on Monday.\nThe U.S. automaker also has scrapped plans to offer a base version of the Silverado EV with a $39,000 price tag, Amy Masica, director of Chevrolet truck marketing, told a media briefing.\nGM in early June joined Ford Motor (F.N) in adopting Tesla's (TSLA.O) North American Charging Standard (NACS), which is fast becoming the norm for EV charging in North America.\nBut GM\u2019s new battery-powered pickups are not yet fully compatible with Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network.\nThe first 2024 Silverado EV Work Trucks are rolling out of GM\u2019s Detroit-Hamtramck plant, with deliveries to fleet customers beginning \u201cin a few weeks,\u201d officials said. The initial model is priced from $77,905, excluding shipping charges.\nA cheaper Work Truck variant arrives late this year, priced from $72,905. About the same time, retail customers will be able to buy a well-equipped Silverado EV RST, from around $105,000.\nA less expensive Trail Boss edition should arrive next year, which is also when the 2025 Silverado EVs should go on sale.\nWhen GM announced the Silverado EV early last year, it said prices would start at $39,900. Silverado EV's nearest rival, the Ford F-150 Lightning, was initially priced at $39,974, but its base sticker has since soared by $20,000 to $59,974.\nMasica said \"conditions have changed\" in the nascent electric pickup sector, but declined to say how low future Silverado EV variants will be priced.\nGM Energy executive Derek Sequeira said at the Silverado launch in late June that GM will only have charging adaptors available for the electric pickups in early 2024.\nEventually, GM will replace the current CCS charging port in its EVs with the Tesla-compatible NACS outlet.\nThat means early models of the Silverado EV and other GM electric vehicles may have to employ a different adapter to use the CCS chargers GM\u2019s existing charging partners provide across the country.\nGM also is considering installing Tesla-compatible NACS chargers at its dealerships, once its vehicles begin to be equipped with NACS charging ports, Sequeira said. Those new GM chargers are likely to carry the Ultium Charge 360 brand, he said.\nAt an investor conference in early June, GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said the automaker has an opportunity to partner with Tesla in developing future locations for EV chargers.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

        "published_date": "June 26, 2023",
        "article_content": "[1/3]Zenobe's Founder Director Steven Meersman shows off one of the company's second-life battery energy storage units that contains part of a battery pack previously used on an electric bus at the startup's innovation centre in Portsmouth, Britain February 20, 2023. REUTERS/Nick Carey\nLONDON, June 26 (Reuters) - Global automakers have touted plans to re-use electric vehicle (EV) batteries when they lose power, but competition for battery packs and cell materials, and the appetite for affordable cars cast doubt on this part of the circular economy.\nAn array of startups offers second-life energy storage using old EV batteries.\nBut creating the viable industry envisioned by carmakers such as Nissan (7201.T) would mean fighting off competition from recyclers, refurbishers and the needs of drivers squeezed by the cost-of-living crisis.\n\"The assumption that EV batteries are only going to last eight-to-10 years and then owners will swap them out is just not true,\" Hans Eric Melin, founder of consultancy Circular Energy Storage (CES), which tracks battery volumes and prices, said. \"It's going to be tricky to make second-life work.\"\nWhile a possible solution for buses, trucks and other commercial vehicles, it will take longer for batteries from passenger cars to be re-used at scale.\nThe second-life energy storage idea is in theory simple.\nAs EV batteries' capacity falls below 80%-85% after eight-to-10 years of use, the theory goes, they will be repurposed to power buildings or even balance local and national energy grids.\nInvestors believing in the circular economy, where products and materials are repaired and re-used, have provided around $1 billion in funding to nearly 50 startups globally, according to Reuters calculations.\nIn addition, carmakers from Mercedes (MBGn.DE) to Nissan have set up their own second-life operations.\nThe problem is a lack of old EV batteries that shows no sign of easing.\nThe rising average age of fossil-fuel cars on the road - now a record 12.5 years in the U.S. according to S&P Global Mobility - suggests many EVs will stay on the road for years to come even if their batteries are depleted.\n\"The 80% threshold is an arbitrary number that does not reflect the real-life usage of EVs,\" CES' Melin said.\nAs EVs built a decade ago remain in use, Elmar Zimmerling, business development manager for automotive at German second-life battery startup Fenecon, said there was \"as good as no market for second-life batteries\" at present, although he predicts a \"tsunami\" of batteries within the next five years.\nCompetition from outfits using EV batteries to power anything from fossil-fuel classic cars to boats pushed prices to $235 per kilowatt hour in late 2022, according to CES - around double the price major carmakers pay for new batteries.\nThe long-range Tesla Model 3 has a 75KWh battery pack. At that rate, it would cost $17,625 on the used market.\nCar and battery-makers increasingly offer energy storage systems using new batteries - from Tesla (TSLA.O) to the UK's AMTE Power (AMTE.L) and even Croatian electric sports car maker Rimac.\nAlthough more energy- and therefore carbon-intensive, recycling also presents another form of competition to re-use as demand for cell materials makes it economically compelling.\n\"The big question is, if you have pretty valuable raw materials in a battery and you ask 'how can I get the most out of it?' the answer is recycling might be better,\" said Thomas Becker, head of sustainability at BMW (BMWG.DE), which has a second-life battery storage facility at its Leipzig plant.\nDemand for used batteries for storage is likely to soar as intermittent renewable energy takes on a bigger role.\nBy 2030 global battery capacity for grid storage could grow to 680 gigawatt-hours, from 16GWh at the end of 2021, the Paris-based International Energy Agency estimates.\nBritain alone pays around 1 billion pounds ($1.27 billion) annually to switch off wind farms when the grid does not need the power - there is no way yet to store it because of the battery shortage. It also often has to buy electricity from Europe when it has a shortfall.\nU.S. startup Smartville has found a solution in buying packs from EVs written off by insurers. Because they cannot assess the extent and cost of even minor damage to EVs batteries, entire cars, often with almost 100% battery capacity, have been scrapped.\nCEO Antoni Tong estimates over 1 GWh of salvaged batteries will hit that U.S. market annually by 2026.\nHe said the company was trying to negotiate directly with insurers because refurbishers and overseas buyers often outbid it at salvage auctions for Tesla batteries.\nThe biggest issue is people keeping their vehicles longer. Jonathan Rivera, a resident of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, illustrates the challenge.\nLast September, he became the third owner of a used 2011 Nissan Leaf he bought for $3,750.\nAfter 12 years' use, the electric car's driving range had fallen to 40 miles (64 km) from 120 miles.\nThat was no problem for Rivera, who used it to commute 18 miles to work, forgoing the heater in the winter because it drained the battery.\nHe has just sold the car for $3,000 to pay down credit card debt, but wants another used EV.\n\"That car handled 90% of my driving needs,\" Rivera said. \"If treated right, it should last another five, six years.\"\nEven when their owners part with them, many cars simply disappear \u2013 in the UK, for instance, the figure is around 20% - and are often sold overseas.\n\"A Nissan Leaf that's been in the wild for 10 years \u2014 there's very limited visibility into where even is that battery?\" said Asad Hussain, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity firm focused on transportation. \"How do you get it back?\"\nCommercial vehicles provide the best hope thus far for second-life batteries, industry officials said.\nLondon-based startup Zenobe, for instance, teams up with bus companies wanting to go electric. They buy the buses, but Zenobe buys and manages the battery, then takes it for second-life energy storage.\nSince 2017, Zenobe has raised around $1.2 billion in debt and equity funding. It owns 435 megawatt-hours of batteries in around 1,000 electric buses in the UK, Australia and New Zealand, which should grow to 3,000 buses by 2025.\nFounder Director Steven Meersman said once Britain's 40,000 buses all go electric, they will have 16 gigawatt-hours of batteries on board \u2013 about one third of Britain's peak demand in 2022.\n\"That's a gigafactory on wheels waiting to happen,\" he said.\n($1 = 0.7851 pounds)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nThomson Reuters\nAutos correspondent in Germany, covering the industry's transition to electric vehicles.

        "article_content": "NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, capping a week dominated by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony in which he signaled more interest rate hikes ahead but vowed the central bank would proceed with caution.\nAll three major U.S. stock indexes lost ground in a broad sell-off. Interest-sensitive megacap stocks weighed heaviest on the tech-laden Nasdaq composite index (.IXIC), led by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O).\nWith few market-moving catalysts this week aside from Powell's congressional testimony, all three indexes notched weekly losses, ending a weeks-long rally.\nThe Nasdaq snapped its eight-week winning streak, its longest since March 2019, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) broke its five-week rally, its longest since November 2021.\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq logged their biggest Friday-to-Friday percentage drops since early March, when the regional banking liquidity crisis hit.\n\"It has been an overbought market, and giving a little bit back,\" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. \"(The rally) has been momentum-driven, with fairly broad participation, and there's nothing surprising about markets taking a pause, and the pause has been fairly orderly.\"\nSan Francisco Fed Bank President Mary Daly said on Friday in an interview with Reuters that two more rate hikes this year is a \"very reasonable\" projection, while echoing Powell's call for more caution in policy decisions.\nAtlanta Fed President Tom Barkin said late Thursday he was unconvinced inflation is on a steady path down to the 2% target, but added he would not predict the outcome of the central bank's July policy meeting.\nFinancial markets have baked in a 74.4% likelihood that the Fed will resume hiking the Fed funds target rate by another 25 basis points at the July meeting, according to CME's FedWatch tool.\n\"You can probably count on a rate hike next month, but it's that second hike that the markets are skeptical of,\" Mayfield added. \"I'll be surprised if the inflation data and other economic data merit that second hike by the time we get to the September (Fed) meeting.\"\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 219.28 points, or 0.65%, to 33,727.43, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 33.56 points, or 0.77%, at 4,348.33 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 138.09 points, or 1.01%, to 13,492.52.\nAll 11 of the major S&P 500 sectors lost ground, with utilities (.SPLRCU) suffering the largest percentage loss.\nChips weighed on tech shares, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (.SOX) sliding 1.8%.\nUsed car marketplace Carmax Inc (KMX.N) posted better-than-expected quarterly profits, sending its shares surging 10.1%.\nStarbucks Corp (SBUX.O) fell 2.5% after its unions said around 3,500 U.S. workers will strike next week to protest the chain's ban on Pride month decorations at its cafes.\nThe CBOE Market Volatility index (.VIX), a gauge of investor anxiety settled at up 0.53 point at 13.44, bouncing off a 3-1/2 year low.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.39-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 35 new highs and 138 new lows.\nThe Russell 2000 finalized the reconstitution of its stock components, which fueled a surge in trading volume.\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 15.93 billion shares, compared with the 11.68 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

        "article_content": "[1/2]A Lordstown Motors sign is seen outside the Lordstown Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio, U.S., June 21, 2021. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo\nNEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - Lordstown Motors (RIDE.O) filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday and put itself up for sale after the U.S. electric truck manufacturer failed to resolve a dispute over a promised investment from Taiwan's Foxconn.\nShares of Lordstown tumbled 35.6% in trading before the bell.\nThe automaker, named after the Ohio town where it is based, filed for Chapter 11 protection in Delaware and simultaneously took legal action against Foxconn.\nIn a complaint filed in bankruptcy court, Lordstown accused the electronics company of fraudulent conduct and a series of broken promises in failing to abide by an agreement to invest up to $170 million in the electric-vehicle manufacturer.\nFoxconn previously invested about $52.7 million in Lordstown as part of the agreement, and currently holds an almost 8.4% stake in the EV maker. Lordstown contends Foxconn is balking at purchasing additional shares of its stock as promised and misled the EV maker about collaborating on vehicle development plans.\nFoxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW), (2317.TW) and best known for assembling Apple's (AAPL.O) iPhones, has said Lordstown breached the investment agreement when the automaker's stock fell below $1 per share. Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe twin filings set up an international business clash that could intensify scrutiny of Foxconn's EV ambitions and partnerships, not only with Lordstown but also other automakers.\nThe lawsuit portrays Foxconn as consistently shifting goal posts in its collaboration with Lordstown on the automaker's future vehicles, which included failing to meet funding commitments and refusing to engage with the company on initiatives Foxconn allegedly directed and purported to support.\nLordstown, a startup launched in 2018, said in a regulatory filing earlier this month that it had planned to sue Foxconn after receiving a letter from the company that led Lordstown to believe Foxconn was unlikely to make its additional expected investment.\nLordstown accused Foxconn in that regulatory filing of engaging in a \u201cpattern of bad faith\u201d that caused \u201cmaterial and irreparable harm\u201d to the company. Even in May, Lordstown warned it might be forced to file for bankruptcy amid uncertainty over the Foxconn investment.\nThe automaker\u2019s main product is the Endurance electric pickup truck, which is built at a former General Motors small-car factory in Lordstown, Ohio, for commercial customers such as local governments. Lordstown sold the plant to Foxconn in 2022.\nLordstown paused production of the Endurance earlier this year and since April has resumed building the trucks at a low rate after resolving quality issues with suppliers. The automaker's shares have plunged since February and currently trade under $3.\nShould Lordstown fail to find a rescuer willing to re-start full production of the Endurance, the Ohio factory now owned by Foxconn could be a draw for overseas automakers looking for a quick way to build vehicles in the United States.\nLordstown filed for bankruptcy with plans to seek a buyer. It does not have an initial offer in hand, known in bankruptcy parlance as a stalking-horse bidder, which sets a minimum price other suitors can top in an auction.\nLordstown Chief Executive Edward Hightower told Reuters the Endurance business could prove attractive to another automaker looking for a fast entry into the EV market at a time the Biden administration's policies are attempting to move away from gasoline-powered cars.\nLordstown's bankruptcy is not the first among the crop of EV startups that went public during the pandemic-era SPAC boom. But Lordstown was a high-profile member of that class because it was challenging the core of the legacy Detroit automakers' business of high-margin pickup trucks, and because of its location.\nThe Lordstown factory in Northeast Ohio was formerly a GM (GM.N) small-car factory that GM decided to close in November 2018. Then-U.S. President Donald Trump and other Ohio political leaders put pressure on GM CEO Mary Barra to reverse the decision, or find a buyer. GM agreed to sell the plant to a newly-formed entity called Lordstown Motors founded by the former top executive at an electric truck maker called Workhorse Group.\nLordstown went public in October 2020 through a reverse merger with special purpose acquisition company DiamondPeak Holdings, joining a flock of EV startups that went public through such deals in that period.\nLike several others, including truck maker Nikola (NKLA.O), Lordstown has struggled to live up to the high expectations of early investors. In 2021, its chief executive and founder, Stephen Burns, resigned after the automaker acknowledged it had overstated pre-orders for its electric trucks.\nLordstown\u2019s finance chief at the time also resigned. Burns has since sold his entire stake in Lordstown, according to a June regulatory filing.\nAs Lordstown wrestled during 2021 and 2022 with investigations by regulators and the U.S. Justice Department, Ford Motor (F.N) was launching its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck, aiming at commercial customers.\nEV startup Rivian (RIVN.O) launched its luxury electric pickup in 2022. GM and Stellantis have announced plans for electric pickups. Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla (TSLA.O) has promised it will begin producing its Cybertruck late this year.\nLordstown struggled to ramp up production of its Endurance trucks over the past several months amid the dispute with Foxconn, challenging market conditions and the cost-intensive nature of its business, the company has said.\nThe few trucks that the company assembled had material costs that were \u201csubstantially higher than our selling price,\u201d Lordstown said in a May regulatory filing.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nThomson Reuters\nMike Spector is a correspondent at Reuters covering corporate crises that span bankruptcy, mass tort litigation and government investigations.
