        "article_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Tesla shouldn\u2019t be calling its partially automated driving system Autopilot because the cars can\u2019t drive themselves, the top U.S. transportation official says.\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says he\u2019s concerned about Tesla\u2019s marketing of the system, which is under investigation by his department in connection with crashes that have caused at least 14 deaths.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that something should be called, for example, an Autopilot, when the fine print says you need to have your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road at all times,\u201d Buttigieg said in an interview with The Associated Press.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an agency within Buttigieg\u2019s department, has sent investigative teams to more than 30 crashes since 2016 in which Teslas suspected of operating on Autopilot or its more sophisticated automated Full Self-Driving system have struck pedestrians, motorcyclists, semi trailers and parked emergency vehicles.\nThe probes are part of a larger investigation by the NHTSA into multiple instances of Teslas using Autopilot crashing into parked emergency vehicles that are tending to other crashes. The NHTSA has become more aggressive in pursuing safety problems with Teslas in the past year, announcing multiple recalls and investigations.\nTesla, based in Austin, Texas, didn\u2019t immediately return messages left Thursday by the AP seeking comment.\nAutopilot can keep a car in its lane and away from vehicles in front of it, while Full Self-Driving can take on most driving tasks. But in each case, Tesla tells owners they must be ready to intervene at all times.\nButtigieg said the Transportation Department will hold Tesla or any other company accountable for complying with federal safety standards. \u201cWe call balls and strikes,\u201d he said. \u201cI view it as something where it\u2019s very important to be very objective. But anytime a company does something wrong or a vehicle needs to be recalled or a design isn\u2019t safe, we\u2019re going to be there.\u201d\nIn the Wednesday interview, Buttigieg said that self-driving vehicles have enormous potential to reduce the nearly 40,000 U.S. roadway deaths that happen each year, a level that he called unacceptable. But he said the technology has not been proved yet. \u201cIt\u2019s far from automatic that it\u2019s going to meet that potential,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to shape here at the Department of Transportation.\u201d\nThe NHTSA also is looking at Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving system. In February, the agency pressured Tesla into recalling nearly 363,000 vehicles with the software because the system can break traffic laws. The problem was to be fixed with an online software update.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said he expects to have fully autonomous vehicles this year, a pledge he has made for several years. \u201cThe trend is very clearly toward full self-driving,\u201d Musk said in April. \u201cAnd I hesitate to say this, but I think we\u2019ll do it this year.\u201d\nThe system is being tested on public roads by as many as 400,000 Tesla owners. But the NHTSA said in documents that the system can make unsafe actions such as traveling straight through an intersection from a turn-only lane, going through a yellow traffic light without proper caution or failing to respond to speed limit changes.\nThe NHTSA also has opened investigations during the past three years into Teslas braking suddenly for no reason, suspension problems and other issues.\nButtigieg wouldn\u2019t comment specifically on the pending investigations. \u201cBoth outside bodies, states and other regulatory entities on the marketing side, and us from a vehicle safety perspective, are always paying attention,\u201d he said.\nNo vehicle on sale today can drive itself, he stressed, saying that drivers must pay attention in all cases.\nThe Justice Department also has asked Tesla for documents about Full Self-Driving and Autopilot.\nButtigieg also touted the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to electrify the nation\u2019s auto fleet.\n\u201cThe bottom line is the automotive sector is going electric, and we want that to happen quickly enough to help us meet our climate goals,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe want it to happen on American soil so that we get these American jobs and we want it to happen in an equitable way that everybody can benefit from.\u2019\u2019\nSen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., has criticized the administration for what he calls lax enforcement of rules that require EV batteries to be produced in North America.\nButtigieg acknowledged \u201csome real differences of opinion\u201d on how to implement the tax provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, but said tax credits that take thousands of dollars off the purchase price of EVs are crucial along with a network of charging stations to accommodate millions of new EVs.\n\u201cThe president set out a goal of 500,000 chargers by the end of this decade. I think we can hit that goal or beat it, but it\u2019s going to take a lot of work,\u2019\u2019 he said, noting that chargers and other benefits from the climate law and 2021 infrastructure law go to every state. \u201cRed states, blue states, purple states all came back with a plan to use those dollars, and they\u2019re all going forward with it right now. So I think we can succeed in this EV revolution.\u2019\u2019\nHe noted that he is a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, former home to the Studebaker car company that went out of business in the 1960s.\n\u201cI know how important it is that we win this time, and that America lead the world in this revolution that is going to happen one way or the other very aggressively,\u201d he said.\nKrisher reported from Detroit.

        "article_content": "Tesla says its first production Cybertruck electric pickup has rolled off the assembly line, nearly two years behind the original schedule.\nThe company tweeted a photo on Saturday showing scores of workers in helmets and yellow vests surrounding the truck.\n\u201cFirst Cybertruck built at Giga Texas!\u201d Tesla tweeted, including a cowboy hat-wearing emoji. Owner Elon Musk retweeted the post.\nMusk unveiled the truck in late 2019, and Tesla had said production would start in late 2021, although the company has since cautioned that production would begin slowly and in smaller numbers than Tesla\u2019s other vehicles.\nWith its wedge shape and stainless-steel body \u2014 which Tesla calls the exoskeleton \u2014 the Cybertruck looks nothing like a traditional pickup. Some analysts have panned it as a niche product that won\u2019t have broad appeal.\nMusk said in April that the company expected to deliver the first truck probably in the July-through-September quarter. He said that as with other new products, production would start slowly and then speed up.\n\u201cIt takes time to get the manufacturing line going,\u201d he said, \u201cand this is really a very radical product. It\u2019s not made in the way that other cars are made. So let\u2019s see.\u201d\nThe truck\u2019s 2019 unveiling veered off course when a window that was touted as unbreakable was spider-cracked when hit by a big metal ball, which prompted an expletive from Musk.\nTesla originally said it would make three versions of the truck, ranging from about $40,000 to $70,000. Later the company removed prices from the page where customers can decide whether to plunk down $100 and place an order.\nCompetitors have rushed into the electric truck market, including the Ford F-150 Lightning and Rivian Automotive\u2019s R1T. Both look like conventional pickups.\nTesla is scheduled to report second-quarter financial results on July 19.",
