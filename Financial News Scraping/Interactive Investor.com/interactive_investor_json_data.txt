        "article_content": "Wall Street has traded at prices not seen since last summer, but a number of major issues rumble on. Our head of markets looks at both current thinking on these plus stock movements on Monday.\nUS markets flagged after an otherwise positive week, as debt ceiling negotiations hit an impasse and were suspended for the weekend.\nWhile the likelihood of what would be a financially catastrophic default is considered low, investors remain on edge and will continue to be so the longer the talks progress. Even so, this current saga is an unwelcome distraction from the current state of the nation in economic terms.\nInvest with ii: Open a Stocks & Shares ISA | ISA Investment Ideas | Transfer a Stocks & Shares ISA\nOpinion is still divided on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest rate move at the June meeting, with the current consensus indicating that there will be a pause to the hiking policy. Indeed, comments from Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday recognised that the recent banking turmoil could lead to reduced bank lending, and in turn slowing growth and dampening inflation.\nAs such, he added that rates may not have to rise as much as had been expected. However, a gulf remains between the current Fed mantra and market expectations of rate cuts before the end of the year.\nElsewhere, a generally better than expected quarterly reporting season continued to wind down, although earnings had been set against extremely low expectations. Outlook comments from corporates were generally cautious, but positive and attention will now turn to the lagging effect of interest rate rises and stubborn inflation on margins and profits. The latest clues will come later in the week with the release of the latest Fed minutes on Wednesday and the Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation number on Friday.\nIn the meantime, mega tech stocks continue to be the most crowded trade as a haven against possible recessionary times to come, with the likes of Apple Inc\nAAPL\n0.67%\n, Microsoft Corp\nMSFT\n3.85%\nand Meta Platforms Inc Class A\nMETA\n1.40%\nall hitting year highs over recent sessions. The Nasdaq has now added 21% in the year to date after a parlous 2022, with the S&P500 up by 9.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 0.8%.\nThe mood in Asia was more upbeat, despite China keeping rates unchanged as expected. While the reasons for the decision are understood to be driven by the fact that its GDP goals are well within reach, there has nonetheless been a raft of recent data suggesting that the economy has lost some momentum after the initial bounce following the reopening.\nMore positively, remarks from the US President over the weekend suggested an imminent thawing of relations between the US and China, and a suggestion that the Group of Seven was not looking to decouple from China in terms of supply chains, but rather to \u201cde-risk\u201d by providing alternative options. \nIn the UK, the first chance to react to a positive Asian session but a weaker US close resulted in something of a stalemate in opening exchanges. Despite broker downgrades to the likes of Kingfisher\nKGF\n2.32%\nand Sainsbury (J)\nSBRY\n0.98%\nproviding a small drag, firms with Chinese exposure such as Standard Chartered\nSTAN\n0.06%\nand Burberry Group\nBRBY\n0.41%\nfound some support. A further pleasing update on the airline sector came with the release of full-year numbers from Ryanair, giving a positive read across to International Consolidated Airlines Group SA\nIAG\n1.65%\nand Rolls-Royce Holdings\nRR.\n0.24%\n. The FTSE100 edged higher and is now up by 4.3% in the year to date.\nThe Week Ahead: Aviva, Kingfisher, M&S, SSE, Fevertree\nHow to beat the US stock market\nThe US shares we own that will outperform Big Tech\nThere will also be updates to the current state of the UK economy in the coming days, with the release of inflation and retail sales data providing further inputs to the Bank of England\u2019s next interest rate decision.\nTo date, the economy has proved more resilient than expected on many metrics, as reflected by a gain of 2.4% for the FTSE250 so far this year. It also remains to be seen on home soil whether the ongoing rate rises will tip the UK over the edge into recession, which the economy has narrowly avoided over several occasions in recent months.",

We are already benefitting from the actions we are taking as well as recovery and growth in our end markets. \n\u201cWe announced several changes to the executive team in March to support the transformation, adding leaders with proven track records of delivery and high-performance.

Rolls is paid by its airline customers depending on how many hours its engines fly.\nShares in the FTSE 100 company fell 6% having almost doubled over the last year. Rival aerospace component marker Melrose Industries\nMRO\n0.19%\nis up by almost a third over that time, while shares for Rolls' customer and owner of British Airways, International Consolidated Airlines Group SA\nIAG\n1.65%\n, has gained by around a quarter. The FTSE 100 index itself is up by close to 6%. \nRolls has more than 15,000 jet engines in service globally powering more than 30 different types of commercial aircraft. Its military engines power some 16,000 planes, helicopters, and vessels, while its Power Systems division sells around 20,000 reciprocating engines annually for marine and industrial applications. \nNew business wins for its Civil Aerospace division included its biggest ever order of 68 Trent XWB-97 engines for Air India, while revenue growth for its Power Systems business had been aided by demand for aftermarket services. \nThe Defence business during the period won the contract to supply engines for submarines being made by BAE Systems\nBA.\n0.68%\nfor Australia under the so called AUKUS agreement \u2013 a pact between the UK, US, and Australia to help preserve a free and open Indo Pacific region. \nBroker UBS summarised the update as offering little new detail although flagged a \u2018buy\u2019 rating on the shares with an estimated fair value price target of 200p per share. \nFirst-half results are scheduled for 3 August. \nii view:\nTracing its history back to 1906, Rolls today employs over 35,000 people with customers in more than 150 countries. Along with the three divisions of Civil, Defence and Power Systems, it also operates a small New Markets division, focused on opportunities for the transition to net zero such as developing small low-cost nuclear reactors and hydrogen powered engines. Civil Aerospace division generates its biggest slice of revenues at around 45%, followed by Defence at 29%, and Power systems at 26%. \nIAG shares keep flying higher after these Q1 results\nRichard Beddard: rich rewards for shareholders in this FTSE 100 company\nThe secrets of investing when inflation is high\nStrategic pushes under its new chief executive include simplifying the business, increasing efficiency, potentially via further cost cuts, and injecting new vigour into its culture, including hiring new executives. A review of investment opportunities will also be carried out, with its New Markets business possibly coming under the microscope. \nFor investors, economic uncertainty including possible further interest rate rises should not be ignored. Exposure to the often volatile and cyclical airline industry deserve thought, as do elevated costs for businesses generally and the still halted dividend payment. \nMore favourably, a broad recovery for the airline industry following the pandemic continues to unfold. Increased geopolitical tensions between the West and Russia and China have seen defence considerations moving up the political agenda, while its ongoing focus on reducing net debt is likely moving it closer to potentially restoring the dividend payment. \nOn balance, and while some caution remains sensible as more good news is built into the share price, underlying trading momentum looks to remain in the company\u2019s favour which should keep longer-term investors happy.  \nPositives: \nNew CEO initiatives  \nInvesting in climate change related product innovation\nNegatives:\nUncertain economic outlook\nDividend payment suspended\nThe average rating of stock market analysts:\nStrong hold",

Here's how they justify a spectacular new price target. \nA bullish report on International Consolidated Airlines Group SA\nIAG\n1.49%\ntoday backed shares to reach 350p as the BA owner enjoys a twin boost from improving demand and falling jet fuel prices.\nBroker Liberum believes a current price of just above 152p also fails to take into account the fact that IAG\u2019s favourable strategic positioning has been unaffected by the pandemic.\nFurthermore, the City firm said supply chain bottlenecks affecting aircraft production should constrain the industry\u2019s ability to erode the favourable conditions through too much capacity.\nLearn more: SIPP Portfolio Ideas | How SIPPs Work | Transfer a SIPP\nLiberum\u2019s upbeat stance comes after IAG said on Friday that full-year operating profit before one-off items will be above previous guidance of between 1.8 billion and 2.3 billion euros (\u00a31.6-\u00a32 billion).\nIt said Iberia contributed a record first-quarter profit as all IAG\u2019s airlines performed above expectations, benefiting from robust demand and a lower fuel price in the quarter. Capacity should be around 97% of 2019 levels for the full year.\nChief executive Luis Gallego added: \u201cWe are seeing healthy forward bookings with leisure demand particularly strong while business travel continues to recover more slowly.\u201d\nIt added a note of caution to its improved guidance by highlighting the potential significant impact of geopolitical and economic events on the price of fuel and on consumer confidence, adding that it has limited visibility of customer bookings for the second half of the year.\nIn the wake of the results, Liberum boosted its operating profit forecast by 27% to 2.9 billion euros for 2023 and by 20% to just over 4 billion euros for 2024. Its new target price of 350p compares with 240p previously.\nDeborah Meaden: The ii Family Money Show\nIAG shares keep flying higher after these Q1 results\nOther broker rating changes this week include Barclays moving to 215p from 170p and Goldman Sachs edging up 5p to 185p, albeit with a neutral recommendation.\nBank of America remains at 240p but said an improving net debt position should \u201cremove investor concerns on the risk of a potential equity raise\u201d.\nDespite the positive broker comment and IAG\u2019s trading momentum, the shares are still within the 130-160p range seen since February. Prior to the pandemic, they had been above 400p.\nLiberum points out that IAG trades on 6.1 times its updated 2023 earnings forecast, falling to 3.8 times for next year.\nIts transport analyst Gerald Khoo said this valuation looked to be more consistent with late cycle multiples, rather than the relatively early stage recovery from the pandemic that IAG is in.\nHe added: \u201cThis year represents only the second profitable year, although the strength of unit revenue combined with the moderation in fuel prices is accelerating the pace of recovery.\n\u201cIn turn, this is accelerating the pace of deleveraging, with IAG back to normal levels of leverage by 2024 on our new estimates.\u201d\nStockwatch: bulls, bears and a global banking crisis\nPut your questions to Lloyds Bank, Shell, L&G and Next\nLiberum\u2019s report adds that IAG\u2019s long-term earnings potential has not been affected by the pandemic, with its favourable strategic positioning still intact. Neither this, nor the strong positive earnings momentum is reflected in the current valuation, it added.\nThe City firm also pointed out that a 1% improvement in revenue would result in a further 13% uplift to its earnings per share forecasts, with a further $100/tonne reduction in jet fuel spot prices adding 15%.\nOn Friday, IAG reported an average jet fuel spot price for the quarter of $910 per metric tonne, some 5% lower than the same quarter of 2022 and reflecting a range of $1,140 in late January and $805 at the end of March.",

        "article_content": "(Alliance News) - Stocks in London were higher at the close on Friday, ahead of a long bank holiday weekend, as the latest US jobs report made a recession across the Atlantic appear less likely.\n\nThe FTSE 100 index closed up 75.74 points, or 1.0% at 7,778.38 on Friday, though the index ended the week as a whole 0.7% lower.\n\nThe FTSE 250 ended up 207.59 points, or 1.1%, at 19,452.50. The AIM All-Share closed up 3.81 points, or 0.5%, at 828.79.\n\nThe Cboe UK 100 ended up 1.0% at 778.28, the Cboe UK 250 closed up 1.1% at 17,054.88, and the Cboe Small Companies ended up 1.0% at 13,628.91.\n\nThe pound was quoted at USD1.2628 at the London equities close on Friday, up from USD1.2565 at the close on Thursday.\n\nEarlier on Friday, sterling hit a one-year high of USD1.2634. The pound climbed as trouble in the US banking sector weighed on the greenback before the strong upward momentum was stemmed by a bullish US jobs report.\n\nFresh data revealed surprise growth in the US employment rate on Friday. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nonfarm payroll employment rose by 253,000 in April, picking up from 165,000 in March.\n\nMarch's number was downwardly revised by 71,000 from 236,000. February's outcome was downwardly revised by 78,000 to 248,000 from 326,000.\n\nThe US economy had been expected to have added 179,000 jobs in April, according to FXStreet cited consensus, so Friday's figure came in markedly ahead of the forecast.\n\nChris Beauchamp, chief market analysts at IG, said: \"Few would have put 'market rally' as the result of a strong payrolls report this afternoon, but that is where we are. 13 successive payrolls reports have come in better than expected, and markets are taking this report as a clear sign of US economic strength.\"\n\nStocks in New York were sharply higher at the London equities close, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1.3%, the S&P 500 index up 1.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.8%.\n\nAgainst the yen, the dollar was trading at JPY134.88, higher compared to JPY133.94 late Thursday.\n\nIn London, BP was the best blue-chip performer, finishing 3.3% higher.\n\nEarlier in the week, the oil major swung to a profit in the first quarter of 2023, as revenue ticked up and impairments were significantly reduced. This led the firm to declare a higher dividend and announce a USD1.75 billion share buyback.\n\nInterContinental Hotels dropped 1.7% despite the hotel operator reporting its revenue per available room in the first quarter of 2023 was up by a third against the year prior.\n\nCompared to the first quarter of 2019, the last pre-pandemic, group RevPAR was up 6.8%\n\n\"We've seen a good start to the year, with continued strong trading in both the Americas and Europe, Middle East, Africa & Asia, and an excellent rebound in demand in Greater China since the lifting of travel restrictions,\" said outgoing Chief Executive Keith Barr.\n\nBarr's final day as CEO will be June 30, IHG announced on Friday. Elie Maalouf will take up the role as group CEO on July 1, after eight years serving as the firm's Americas CEO.\n\nInternational Consolidated Airlines climbed 1.7%.\n\nThe British Airways parent reported a narrowed first quarter loss, alongside strong revenue, and noted its capacity was recovering towards pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIAG said pretax loss for the first three months of 2023 narrowed substantially to EUR121 million from EUR916 million a year prior. Revenue was EUR5.89 billion, up 74% from EUR3.44 billion the year before.\n\nLiberum's Gerald Khoo said the results were \"surprisingly strong\", with IAG benefitting from both a strong unit revenue environment and lower fuel prices. Khoo added that this was \"impressive\" for the \"seasonally weakest quarter.\"\n\nIn the FTSE 250, RHI Magnesita climbed 2.3% as it reported lower refractory sales volumes in the first quarter of the year, in line with management expectations and overall market demand.\n\nLooking ahead, the company said order book trends suggest the potential for a gradual recovery in steel customer demand in the short term, though it warned that the outlook for end markets and customer volumes remains uncertain and a significant recovery in volumes is not expected.\n\nNonetheless, RHI Magnesita added that it is confident it will achieve its current guidance for 2023.\n\nElsewhere in London, Aptamer plunged 51% after it announced it expects \"significantly lower\" revenue for the financial year ending June 30.\n\nAptamer said revenue for the ten months ended April 30 was approximately GBP1.4 million, with its pipeline taking \"longer than expected to convert\". As a result, the life sciences company now anticipates revenues for the current financial year to be \"materially below\" the GBP4.0 million reported last year.\n\nIn European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris ended up 1.3%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended 1.4% higher.\n\nThe euro stood at USD1.1016 at the European equities close on Friday, higher against USD1.1002 at the same time on Thursday.\n\nCommerzbank Analyst Ulrich Leuchtmann said that the market viewed Thursday's European Central Bank rate decision and the subsequent press conference with President Christine Lagarde to be mostly \"EUR-negative\".\n\nLagarde on Thursday said a slowdown in the pace of the Frankfurt-based institution's rate hikes is not a sign that a pause in monetary policy tightening is looming.\n\nShe said she believes the ECB still has \"more ground to cover\" in the fight against inflation, adding that the central bank is yet to see enough transmission from previous hikes to the \"real activity\" part of the economy.\n\nBrent oil was quoted at USD74.94 a barrel at the London equities close on Friday, up from USD72.38 late Thursday. Gold was quoted at USD2,013.19 an ounce, lower against USD2,049.92 at the close on Thursday.\n\nIn the economic calendar next week, financial markets in the UK are closed on Monday for the coronation of King Charles III. On Thursday, the Bank of England will announce its interest rate decision.\n\nBy Heather Rydings, Alliance News senior economics reporter\n\nComments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com\n\nCopyright 2023 Alliance News Ltd.

        "article_content": "(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London were higher at midday on Friday, a better end to a nervy week for equities, with investors digesting central bank decisions and an ongoing crisis in the US regional banking sector.\n\nFocus later will be on the US nonfarm payrolls report for April. On the UK political front, there were also a steady stream of local election results, which have bruised Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nThe FTSE 100 index was up 37.50 points, 0.5%, at 7,740.14. It is down 1.7% so far this week, however.\n\nThe FTSE 250 was up 119.00 points, 0.6%, at 19,363.91, and the AIM All-Share was up 1.34 points, 0.2%, at 826.32.\n\nThe Cboe UK 100 was up 0.4% at 774.04, the Cboe UK 250 up 0.7% at 16,979.96, and the Cboe Small Companies down 0.2% at 13,493.31.\n\nIn European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.5%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.8%.\n\nStocks in New York are called higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is called up 0.4%, while both the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite are called up 0.6%.\n\nInvestors continue to be spooked by developments in the banking sector. Shares in PacWest fell 51% in New York on Thursday after the regional lender said it had been approached by potential partners and investors over a potential sale. Blue-chip banks also closed in the red.\n\nThe dollar fell, amid the crisis in the regional banking sector and as currency traders mull what that means for monetary policy.\n\nThe pound was quoted at USD1.2611 at midday on Friday in London, higher compared to USD1.2565 at the equities close on Thursday. The euro stood at USD1.1026, up against USD1.1002. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JPY134.27, up compared to JPY133.94.\n\nThe pound hit a one-year high of around of USD1.2634 on Friday morning, with the dollar under pressure after the Federal Reserve earlier this week strongly hinted at a rate hike pause.\n\nAJ Bell analyst Russ Mould said a crisis in US midsized lending may lead \"to increasing bets the Federal Reserve may have to move from a pause on interest rate hikes to actually cutting rates\".\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the Federal Reserve lifted US interest rates by 25 basis points, but strongly hinted this was the end of its current tightening cycle.\n\nThe ECB lifted its own interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, resisting the urge to enact another half-point hike. President Christine Lagarde said the ECB still has ground to cover, however.\n\nThe latest US nonfarm payrolls report is due at 1330 BST. The US economy is expected to have added 179,000 jobs in April, easing from 236,000 in March, according to FXStreet cited consensus.\n\nIn the UK, votes are still being tallied in some of the 230 local authorities in England that held elections on Thursday.\n\nEarly results indicated major losses for Sunak's Conservative party in his first electoral test as prime minister, as the Tories ceded control of several councils to Labour and the Liberal Democrats.\n\nLabour claimed the results suggest leader Keir Starmer will be able to replace Sunak in Number 10 next year.\n\nAmong London listings, British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines rose 2.7%. IAG reported a strong performance in the first quarter, as capacity recovered to close to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nRevenue rose 71% year-on-year to EUR5.89 billion from EUR3.44 billion. Its pretax loss narrowed substantially to EUR121 million from EUR916 million.\n\nThe performance was stronger than expected at all of its airlines, with BA returning to profit for the first since the beginning of 2019. The outperformance was mostly thanks to leisure demand for both long-haul and short-haul flights, IAG said.\n\n\"We are seeing healthy forward bookings with leisure demand particularly strong, while business travel continues to recover more slowly,\" said Chief Executive Luis Gallego.\n\nIAG raised guidance for annual pre-exceptional operating profit to above the top end of previous guidance of EUR1.8 to EUR2.3 billion.\n\n\"The company is benefiting in two ways. Easing oil prices have helped with fuel costs while passenger demand has been robust. Crucially, and despite the pressures on household budgets, jetting away continues to be prioritised when it comes to spending decisions and bookings are healthy,\" AJ Bell's Mould commented.\n\n\"There is one fly in the ointment. The rebound in business travel, an important area for the group, remains sluggish and three years on from the start of the pandemic there may be fears this is becoming a structural issue with companies no longer as willing to fund these kinds of trips as regularly.\"\n\nInterContinental Hotels Group lost 2.3%.\n\nThe Windsor, Berkshire-based operator of the InterContinental, Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotel chains said Keith Barr's final day as CEO will be June 30, remaining available to the firm until the end of the year.\n\nElie Maalouf will take up the role as group CEO on July 1, after eight years serving as the firm's Americas CEO. A process is underway to find a successor to the Americas CEO role, IHG said.\n\nBarr has worked for IHG for more than 30 years, IHG noted.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2023, IHG said revenue per available room was up 33% from a year earlier. It was up 18% in Americas, up 64% in Europe Middle East Africa & Asia, and surged 75% in China.\n\n\"We've seen a good start to the year, with continued strong trading in both the Americas and EMEAA, and an excellent rebound in demand in Greater China since the lifting of travel restrictions,\" said outgoing CEO Barr.\n\nOn AIM, Aptamer plummeted 61%, after the developer of novel Optimer binders for the life sciences industry updated on its financial year ending June 30.\n\nIn the first 10 months, revenue was around GBP1.4 million, with its pipeline taking \"longer than expected to convert\". The delays were particularly apparent in licensing and royalty-based contracts.\n\nIt now expects annual revenue to be \"materially\" below the previous year's level of GBP4.0 million.\n\nWith cash running low at GBP700,000 at the end of April, Aptamer is mulling a range of funding options, which could be non-dilutive or dilutive in nature.\n\nBrent oil was quoted at USD74.33 a barrel at midday in London on Friday, up from USD72.38 late Thursday. Gold was quoted at USD2,037.22 an ounce, down against USD2,049.92.\n\nBy Sophie Rose, Alliance News reporter\n\nComments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com\n\nCopyright 2023 Alliance News Ltd.

This was driven by Iberia's performance for the quarter, as well as improved passenger capacity levels post-pandemic.\n\nLooking ahead, IAG noted an \"encouraging\" outlook for the summer period, with around 80% of its second quarter revenue booked. The company also expects its operating profit to be above the top end of its 2023 guidance of EUR1.8 billion to EUR2.3 billion.\n\nCustomer demand currently remains strong, and passenger capacity is expected to be around 97% of 2019 levels for the full year, as the company focuses on its core markets, IAG said.\n\nChief Executive Officer Luis Gallego said: \"Iberia contributed a record first quarter profit and all our airlines performed above expectations, benefiting from robust demand and a lower fuel price in the quarter. We are seeing healthy forward bookings with leisure demand particularly strong while business travel continues to recover more slowly.\n\n\"As we return to more normal operations, we continue to invest in sustainability, including more fuel-efficient aircraft, and in customer experience, updating the business cabins for British Airways and Iberia. Over the past year, we have recruited thousands of new employees across the group and strengthened our operations so that we are ready to deliver for our customers during the summer peak.\"\n\nShares in IAG were up 3.8% at 152.70 pence each in London on Friday morning.\n\nBy Sabrina Penty, Alliance News reporter\n\nComments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com\n\nCopyright 2023 Alliance News Ltd.

However, oil is still on track for its third week of losses reflecting uncertainty about the global economic outlook and the threat of weaker demand, particularly from China.\nADIDAS \nadidas AG\nADS\n0.17%\nreported first-quarter sales of 5.27 billion euros, beating analysts\u2019 expectations thanks to strong demand for the Terrace shoe as well as the Samba and Gazelle. Operating profit hit 60 million euros, quadrupling consensus forecasts for 15 million euros. However, it still reported a net loss from continuing operations of 24 million euros and gross margins declined. \nThere appear to be green shoots of optimism for the sportswear giant which is still reeling from the Yeezy / Kanye West crisis after its partnership with Ye ended last year. This resulted in a 400 million euro dash to sales, hitting North America hardest and leaving Adidas with a huge pile of unsold shoe inventory. CEO Bjorn Gulden who took to the helm at the start of the year said 2023 will be a \u2018bumpy year\u2019 and the loss of Yeezy is \u2018of course hurting us\u2019. Adidas has also been grappling with cost inflation and the softening consumer backdrop which has led to greater discounting. \nAlthough shares fell sharply in October after its Yeezy deal terminated, shares have been rebounding over the last six months. Investors are also optimistic about new CEO Bj\u00f8rn Gulden, thanks to his impressive CV including his recent nine-year term at Puma at which he helped spearhead the brand\u2019s revival. \nINTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP \nKeith Barr is stepping down as chief executive of InterContinental Hotels Group\nIHG\n0.11%\non 30 June and will be replaced with Elie Maalouf, the current Americas CEO on 1 July. Barr will remain available to support and advise the business until the end of the year. He has been CEO since July 2017 and on the executive committee since April 2011. Barr helped steer the hotel group through the extreme challenges of the pandemic and Brexit with shares up around 30% under his near six-year tenure, sharply outperforming the FTSE 100. He recently chimed in on the debate about City of London\u2019s position as a global financial hub after Brexit saying it is \u2018not a very attractive place to list new companies\u2019 but IHG remains listed on the LSE nonetheless.   \nIHG reported revenue per available room (RevPAR), which is calculated by multiplying average daily room rates by occupancy rates, up by 33% year-on-year and 6.8% versus 2019 as the group behind Holiday Inn hotels enjoys a post-pandemic bounce back. Greater China was a bright spot with RevPAR up 75%, thanks to Beijing\u2019s removal of its anti-Covid lockdown measures and the release of pent-up demand from the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Business and group travel continues to bounce back post Covid however IHG flagged the \u2018ongoing economic uncertainties\u2019 and said financing challenges are holding back new hotel development activity and the wider real estate industry. \nLast year, IHG launched its biggest marketing campaign in a decade and overhauled its One Rewards scheme, helping add millions to its loyalty programme and boosting occupancy rates. \nShares in IHG have enjoyed a strong year-to-date performance up around 11% but are under pressure today, reflecting the departure of its CEO. IHG is also lagging US rivals Hilton and Marriott so far in 2023 both in terms of forward PE ratios and percentage gains.\nAPPLE \nApple Inc\nAAPL\n0.67%\nreported fiscal second-quarter earnings which topped analysts\u2019 expectations, with earnings per share hitting $1.52 versus estimates for $1.43. Revenue reached $94.84 billion also ahead of forecasts for $92.96 billion and gross margin came in at 44.3%, again outpacing consensus estimates. This was largely thanks to a \u2018significant acceleration\u2019 in iPhone sales which make up more than half of the tech giant\u2019s overall revenue. \nHowever, other hardware such as Mac sales disappointed, falling 31% and iPad revenues fell 13% year-on-year as the pandemic era tech boom (when we were glued to our devices at home) fades. Apple is trying to focus more on services such as Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Pay. This division saw revenues reach another record high, up 5.5% to $20.91 billion despite the macroeconomic headwinds. \nShares in Apple gained more than 2% after-hours trading, lifting the stock to a gain of more than a third since the start of 2023 as it continues to rebound after last year\u2019s \u2018tech wreck\u2019 which sharply punished the sector.",

        "article_content": "(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened higher on Friday, with oil companies and an encouraging trading update from International Consolidated Airlines boosting the FTSE 100.\n\nThe index opened up 56.10 points, 0.7% at 7,758.74. The FTSE 250 was up 78.16 points, 0.4%, at 19,323.07, and the AIM All-Share was up 2.62 points, 0.3%, at 827.60.\n\nThe Cboe UK 100 was up 0.7% at 776.27. The Cboe UK 250 was up 0.5% at 16,950.10. The Cboe Small Companies was marginally lower at 13,513.74.\n\nIn European equities, the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt were both up 0.5%.\n\nSterling climbed to USD1.2631 early Friday, firm on USD1.2565 at the London equities close on Thursday.\n\nThe euro was stronger, following a 25 basis point interest rate hike by the European Central Bank on Thursday.\n\nThe single currency traded at USD1.1045 early Friday, higher than USD1.1002 late Thursday. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JPY133.95, unchanged from JPY133.94.\n\nInvestors in New York on Thursday continued to be spooked by developments in the banking sector, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending down 0.9%, the S&P 500 down 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.5%.\n\nShares in PacWest fell 51% after the regional lender said it had been approached by potential partners and investors over a potential sale. Blue-chip banks also closed in the red.\n\nHowever, Apple rose 2.5% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company reported a slight decline in second-quarter revenue and earnings, but its results exceeded forecasts. In particular, iPhone sales of USD51.33 billion beat market expectations of USD48.66 billion.\n\nThe latest numbers come after the company in February posted its first quarterly revenue drop in nearly four years after pandemic-driven restrictions on its China factories curtailed sales of the latest iPhone during the holiday season.\n\n\"The group's impenetrable brand is...holding it in good stead, but the overarching theme of these numbers is that consumers are very much starting to pull back on buying bigger-ticket items,\" said Hargreaves Lansdown's Sophie Lund-Yates.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, London time, there will be the latest US jobs print. Nonfarm payroll net additions are expected to have slowed to 179,000 in April from 236,000 in March, according to FXStreet.\n\n\"A soft NFP read, and ideally softening wages growth could further fuel the Fed doves and boost Fed rate cut expectations,\" said Swissquote Bank's Ipek Ozkardeskaya\n\nIn the FTSE 100, British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines rose 4.1%. IAG reported a strong performance in the first quarter, as capacity recovered to close to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nRevenue rose 71% year-on-year to EUR5.89 billion from EUR3.44 billion. Loss before tax narrowed substantially to EUR121 million from EUR916 million.\n\nThe performance was stronger than expected at all of its airlines, with BA returning to profit for the first since the beginning of 2019. The outperformance was mostly thanks to leisure demand for both long-haul and short-haul flights, IAG said.\n\n\"We are seeing healthy forward bookings with leisure demand particularly strong, while business travel continues to recover more slowly,\" said CEO Luis Gallego.\n\nIAG raised guidance for annual pre-exceptional operating profit to above the top end of previous guidance of EUR1.8 to EUR2.3 billion.\n\nThe update is a clearly \"welcome development\", according to interactive investor's Richard Hunter, but the road to recovery remains \"long and arduous\".\n\n\"Strong demand and a slightly lower fuel price in this quarter are helpful, but do not necessarily establish a trend,\" he warned.\n\nInterContinental Hotels fell 1.3%, after it updated on trading in the first quarter and announced the departure of its CEO.\n\nRevenue per available room rose 33% year-on-year. RevPAR was up 18% in the Americas, up 68% in Europe, Middle East & Africa, and by 75% in Greater China. RevPAR also was ahead of pre-pandemic 2019 levels in all regions, except Greater China, where it remained down 9.1%.\n\n\"We look forward to making additional progress over the course of 2023 in further evolving our brand portfolio, increasing RevPAR and expanding our system size,\" said CEO Keith Barr.\n\nIHG separately announced Barr will step down at the end of June, to return to his family in the US. He will be succeeded by Elie Maalouf, who currently is head of Americas.\n\nIn the FTSE 250, Ithaca Energy rose 4.7%, as it signed an agreement with Shell setting out a marketing process for some or all of Shell's 30% working interest in the Cambo field in the UK North Sea.\n\nShell has decided to sell its stake after an internal review.\n\nThe agreement allows for a range of possibilities, but Ithaca will retain a 50% stake in Cambo in all eventualities. It also gives Shell the option of selling any of its stake, which is not sold to a third party, to Ithaca. This will follow the conclusion of a six-month marketing process.\n\n\"Securing a new owner for Shell's stake is an important step in Ithaca Energy progressing to final investment decision,\" Ithaca CEO Alan Bruce explained.\n\nShell was up 1.7%. BP added 2.8%.\n\nBrent oil fetched USD73.42 a barrel early Friday, higher than USD72.38 late Thursday.\n\n\"Brent crude has lost around 9% this week, with Federal Reserve and ECB interest rate hikes sapping momentum out of predicted demand. Added to that pressure, there was an unexpected contraction in Chinese manufacturing activity, because of poorer global demand,\" said HL's Lund-Yates.\n\nChina's services sector saw strong growth in April, though at a slightly slower pace than the month before, survey data showed, helping to offset a contraction in manufacturing.\n\nThe latest Caixin services purchasing managers' index fell to 56.4 points in April from 57.8 in March. Falling closer towards the 50-point no-change mark, it shows growth slowed slightly during the month.\n\nHowever, being the second-best reading since November 2020, it still points to a strong expansion of activity in the services sector. The strong expansion helped to offset a decline in manufacturing, as the composite PMI - which weighs the services and manufacturing sectors - fell to 53.6 from 54.5, but remained above 50.\n\nIn China, the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.5%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was up 0.4%. Financial markets in Japan were closed for Children's Day. The S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney was closed up 0.4%.\n\nBack in London, AIM-listed IT consulting firm TPXImpact rose 12%.\n\nThe company raised its annual guidance for financial 2024, after a strong final quarter ended March 31. Trading was at the higher end of previous guidance during the quarter, with the board now expecting annual revenue of around GBP83 million for financial 2023. This would be up from GBP79.7 million the year before.\n\nFor financial 2024, TPXImpact raised its guidance for organic revenue growth to a 15% to 20% range, from 10% to 15% previously.\n\n\"April 2023 marked a record for the group with new business wins exceeding GBP80 million, highlighting the opportunity available for TPX as it secures larger contracts while optimised for efficiency under one brand,\" the company said.\n\nMeanwhile in the UK, votes were being tallied in the 230 local authorities in England that held elections on Thursday.\n\nEarly results indicated major losses for Rishi Sunak's Conservative party in his first electoral test as prime minister, as the Tories lost ceded control of several councils to Labour and the Liberal Democrats.\n\nLabour claimed the results suggest leader Keir Starmer will be able to replace Sunak in No 10 next year.\n\nGold was quoted at USD2,048.23 an ounce early Friday, edging down from USD2,049.92 on Thursday.\n\nIn the economic calendar, the eagerly-awaited US non-farm payrolls will be released at 1330 BST. Before that, there's a UK construction PMI at 0930 BST, and EU retail sales at 1000 BST.\n\nBy Elizabeth Winter, Alliance News senior markets reporter\n\nComments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com\n\nCopyright 2023 Alliance News Ltd.

        "article_content": "Quarterly results from International Consolidated Airlines have been well received, but our head of markets explains the risk of possible turbulence.\nEven though the British Airways owner has flown back to profit for the first quarter since 2019, the numbers underline that full recovery remains a long-haul journey.\nThere are a number of positives within International Consolidated Airlines Group SA\nIAG\n1.39%\n' statement showing that the direction of travel has at last changed for the better. Revenues rose by 71% to \u20ac5.89 billion from the previous year, helped along by strong demand particularly within leisure, and showing the determination of a cost-pressured consumer to continue travelling. There is also a growing contribution from alternative sources of revenue, which hit \u20ac525 million for the quarter, coming from Iberia\u2019s third party maintenance business, BA Holidays and the IAG Loyalty scheme.\nLearn more: SIPP Portfolio Ideas | How SIPPs Work | Transfer a SIPP\nAt the same time, passenger numbers increased by 69% compared to a year previous and have now all but returned to pre-pandemic levels across the network. This comes despite a slower recovery in the business travel market, previously such a strength of the British Airways offering, and where the adoption of apps such as Teams and Zoom has severely reduced the need for face-to-face meetings.\nThe generally improving picture has revealed a sight which will be of some relief to long-suffering shareholders, namely a return to quarterly profit. Adjusted operating profit of \u20ac9 million compares to a loss of \u20ac741 million the year previous, and substantially outperforms estimates of another \u20ac207 million loss. \nIndeed, IAG has upgraded its full-year guidance given these most recent tailwinds. Operating profit has been raised to above the top end of previous expectations, with 97% of 2019 capacity now expected. In addition, the group now expects for net debt to reduce further, as opposed to the previous estimate that it would largely remain the same.\nThe issue of net debt is arguably the biggest thorn in the side for IAG, representing an overhang from the days of the pandemic when the group was forced to ratchet up borrowings to survive. In this quarter alone, finance costs ran to \u20ac274 million, with the net debt figure currently standing at \u20ac8.4 billion. More positively, this is an improvement of 19% from the \u20ac10.4 billion number from the corresponding period. The group is well aware that this line needs particular attention and, as such, even the thought of a return to a dividend payment remains a distant dream.\nIAG will also be hoping that the rest of the year plays out along these lines. For the second quarter, 80% of revenues have already been booked, although it remains too early to guess how the less seasonally popular months will fare. The headwinds which have blighted the sector are never far away, meaning that airline stocks have long been a traditionally hazardous investment, variously affected by virus outbreaks, industrial action, volcanic dust clouds and higher fuel costs. The pandemic added another level of issues, while current macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns add to a potentially dangerous mix.\nShares for the future: how I would set up a new portfolio step by step\nBuy and hold versus changing style: which fund approach is best?\nLord Sebastian Coe: The ii Family Money Show\nThe improvement in the group\u2019s fortunes is a welcome development as evidenced by the initial price reaction to the release, but the road to recovery remains long and arduous. Strong demand and a slightly lower fuel price in this quarter are helpful, but do not necessarily establish a trend.\nThe share price has reflected the turbulence of airline investing, having risen by 18% over the last six months but having dropped by 15% over the last quarter. Over the last year, the shares have added just 1%, as compared to a rise of 2.7% for the wider FTSE100 index, and the fact that the price remains down by 65% over a five-year period is further evidence of the repair needed. With visibility clearing but far from guaranteed, the market consensus remains marginally positive for prospects, coming in at a 'cautious buy'.",

        "article_content": "(Alliance News) - Stocks in London were called higher on Friday, as investors mulled over the latest interest rate decisions in the US and the EU and ahead of the US nonfarm payrolls report.\n\nEarly Friday, new data showed German manufacturing orders in March saw their worst decline since the outbreak of Covid.\n\nMeanwhile, in the UK, local elections results were being tallied. The ruling Tories appear to have suffered major losses in Rishi Sunak's first electoral test as prime minister, with the opposition Labour party claiming the results suggest leader Keir Starmer will be able to replace him in No 10.\n\nIn early company news, InterContinental Hotels announced a robust first-quarter recovery in revenue, and its CEO will depart next month.
