## Create a spotify list with the top 100 BillBoard songs on your birthday

# Objective

Scrape the top 100 songs from billboard matching the day you were born, list the song titles, search them on your spotify and then add them to a new dedicated playlist on your spotify

```
The central idea behind this project is to be able to use BeautifulSoup to obtain some data - like songs titles - from a website like Empire's (or from, say Timeout or Stacker that have curated similar lists). 

### ⚠️ Important: Use the Internet Archive's URL

**use this link** and change the change to your birthday
```
URL = "https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1996-01-01/"
```
You must connect to your spotify account and change spotify_client_id and spotify_client_secret  to your own ones
```
